Diamond Dash is a thrilling 2D Java platformer that challenges players to navigate through two distinct levelsâ€”a lush, vibrant landscape and a barren, arid terrain. In each level, your goal is to collect all the scattered diamonds to advance and ultimately win the game. Along the way, you'll encounter hostile enemies that guard the precious gems, adding an extra layer of excitement and danger to your quest. Sharpen your skills and prepare for an adventure where every diamond counts!
